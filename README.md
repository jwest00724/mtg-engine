# MTG Codes v9
PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS.
Text-based online RPG

### Where's the demo?!
Thanks to Justin from [JMBGaming](http://jmbgaming.com), you can now view and explore, in depth, the entirety of MTG Engine right [here](http://engine.magictallguy.tk)!

### There's nothin' there?! ###
This is still in its early-alpha stages. My plans are to add a form of "Mod Manager" which will allow site owners to install mods from within the game.
Once I've got that up and running, modifications should be pretty straight forward. Until then, you'll have to deal with hard-code!

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the files from here
* Upload them to your public_html (or htdocs/www)
* Create a database and user
* Go to the URL of wherever you just uploaded them - go through it and fill in the details
* Login

### I found a bug! ###
At this stage, that is to be expected.
If you're able to repair it, please do and submit the fix back. If not, simply open a report here!

Awesome! Simply fork my repo, make your changes/additions, and submit a merge request!
